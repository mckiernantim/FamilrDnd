    title: "Zombie Crisis",
    text: `Nearly a dozen reports of hyper-aggresive were added to a rapidly growing list of reported "Psycho Zombieheads".  A wood caste halfling of little honor was nullified by honorable district 6 militiamen.  Witneses on the scene reported the small statured female exibitiing all the normal signs of Zombie intoxication: lethargy, blank vacant eyes, and a lack of awareness.  Not uncommon to the area, many local Wood scum who lack the drive of their better castes, turn to Zombie as an escape from reality.  It's dual properties as a powerful sedative, and its metabolic retarding properties, mean that any lowlife who scores a hit of "Big Z" on the street can survive with little food for up to two or three days while numbing the pain of their pathetic lives.  The curious case of these Zombie heads suddenly and viciously attacking random bystanders seems to fly in the face of conventional Zombie wisdom. Some say there must be  a new strain of "Z" out on the streets?  Others are convinced this is this some sick perversion of the mind, a gradual slipping in mental capacity amongst the lower caste that is inevitable and harsher crackdowns must be made on the Wood hoods.  When asked for comment a local Wood simply said "Ain't no Z for me. No sir.  I sticks with my Glurb"`,

    title: "Gorland Witness to Testify",
    text: `Embattled Human politcal dynamo Oreck Gorland's bid for reelection was dealt another blow today.  Embroiled in a dark money controversy involving ties to Both the Kommona Tong, Disgraced Karoshi criminal Du'rden Agrock, and a slew of newly discovere Ilithid dens, Gorlands reelection campaaign hangs in the balance as he stands accused of profiting off of a complex web of chem money, nuero-loading, and connetion more than five dozen murders during his six years in office.  Garland, known for his ploitical savy, has managed to survive any controversy thus far, but now a witness - an unkoown quote 'Tong Dragon' is slated to testify at an honor hearing tommorow, noon at the Hopwell industries hall of justice in the Caverns.`,

      title:"1908th spotted again",
      text:" The Legend of the 1908th Black Guard is somewhat of a tradition here in WoodGullet.  One that parents have been using to frighten their children in to an extra pound of scrap harvest or get them to finish their D-bricks.  Dating back to the early stages of the War of Dwarven aggression, the story goes that an elite forward brigade of Black Guard Reavers were sent a self populating survival bunker.  Such tech would allow them to operate a foward assault base complete with Terminus reactor, munitions fabrication, and Organic synth systems.  In short, these stalwarts were equipped to fight like the honorable Titans we could only aim to become.   So well were the 1908th that after the war ended, they've refused to give in.  Still continuoimg the fight at night, emerging from their secure bunker to strike out on dishonorable targets in an attempt to brin the glory of the Empire to East Passage once more.  This reporter for one - hopes they NEVER stop the fight.  And to any Wood castes who are lucky enough to stumble upon the 1908th Forward Operating Bunker - well bud, you do what Woods are best at - Run away before you feel the wrath of a true Titan."
